# qa-webapp-project

## Overview
This is a hands-on Quality Assurance (QA) project testing a user gallery system (registration, login, image uploads, and gallery functionality). This project demonstrates end-to-end manual QA testing of a PHP/MySQL web application simulating an image gallery. It focuses on:
- Identifying functional/non-functional bugs through structured test cases.
- Documenting resolutions for server, UI, and edge-case issues.
- Practicing regression testing and environment validation.

## QA Objectives & Outcomes
- Bug documentation: Documented 20+ test cases (Excel) with 6 critical bugs found and resolved.
- Regression testing: Verified fixes across PHP 8.3 and MySQL versions.
- Envinronment Debugging: Solved Apache config issues and Linux file permission errors. 
- Edge-Case Coverage: Tested duplicate emails, invalid uploads, unauthorized access, and more.

## Testing Scope
1. Functional Testing
- User flows: Registration -> Login -> Image Upload -> View Gallery
- Edge cases: Empty form submissions, invalid file types (PDFs, >2MB uploads).
2. Non-functional Testing
- UI Consistency: Cross-browser testing.
- Error Handling: Verified user-friendly messages for failures.
3. Environment Validation
- Environment and server validation (Apache, PHP, MySQL setup).
- Verified MySQL table structures and query errors. 

## Tech Stack & Tools
- Backend: PHP 8+, MySQL, Apache
- Infrastructure: Ubuntu (via VirtualBox), Linux file permissions
- QA Tools: Structured test cases (Excel), Browser DevTools, PHP error logs
- Soft skills: Bug documentation, troubleshooting, collaboration (simulated via Git commits)

## Key QA Skills Demonstrated
- Bug Documentation: Wrote reproducible bug reports with steps, expected vs. actual results.
- Test Coverage: Prioritized high-impact edge cases.
- Process Ownership: Self-directed testing lifecycle (plan -> execute -> document -> retest).
- Writing structured test cases
- Analyzing error logs and warnings

## Notes
- This project was developed as a self-guided QA initiative to gain hands-on experience testing a real web application environmnent. The backend code was scaffolded with AI assistance to simulate a production-like system, while **all QA processes** such as test planning, bug discovery, documentation, and validation, were executed independently.
- Future Improvements: Add Selenium automation or Postman API tests.
